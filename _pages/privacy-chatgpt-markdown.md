## Overview

**Deep Research to Markdown** is a Chrome extension that exports ChatGPT Deep Research reports to Markdown format. This policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Period.

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is tracked
- No analytics or telemetry is sent
- No data is transmitted to any server

## How It Works

The extension runs **entirely in your browser**. When you click "Export":

1. It reads the current ChatGPT conversation from your browser tab
2. It converts the content to Markdown format
3. It copies the result to your clipboard or downloads it as a file

**All processing happens locally on your device.** Nothing leaves your browser.

## ChatGPT Authentication

The extension uses your existing ChatGPT session (the one already active in your browser) to read conversation data. It does **not** store, copy, or transmit your authentication token. The token is only used locally within the browser tab to fetch the conversation you are viewing.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does **not** communicate with any third-party services, APIs, or servers. It only interacts with the ChatGPT website that is already open in your browser.

## Data Storage

This extension does **not** store any data. No cookies, no local storage, no databases. Each time you use it, it reads the current page and produces output — nothing is saved.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this policy, the new version will be posted at this URL. We will update the "Last updated" date at the top.
