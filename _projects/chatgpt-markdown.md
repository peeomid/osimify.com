## What it is
A Chrome extension that exports ChatGPT Deep Research reports to properly formatted Markdown. It converts messy citation markers into clean footnote-style references and builds a full References section with titles and URLs.

## Key features
- One-click copy to clipboard or download as `.md`

- Options to include/exclude references or inline links
- All processing happens locally — no data sent anywhere
